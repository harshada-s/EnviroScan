In an era marked by environmental degradation and resource depletion, effective waste management has become
imperative for sustainable development. One significant aspect of waste management is the segregation of
recyclable materials from non-recyclable ones, a process that traditionally relies heavily on manual sorting.
However, manual sorting is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors, leading to inefficiencies in
recycling processes.
To address these challenges, our project focuses on developing an automated waste segregation system using
computer vision technology. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we aim to
streamline the process of sorting recyclable waste from non-recyclable waste, thereby enhancing the efficiency
and effectiveness of recycling operations. Through this report, we present the methodology, implementation, and
evaluation of our automated waste segregation system, highlighting its potential impact on waste management
practices and environmental conservation efforts
